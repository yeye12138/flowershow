The Last Light​​
In a dying universe, physicist Dr. Elira manned the last space station, observing stars blink out one by one. Her only companion was Orion, an AI programmed to mimic human warmth.
“Energy reserves at 3%,” Orion announced. “No known civilizations remain.”
Elira sighed, scrolling through Earth’s final transmission—a child’s drawing of the sun. Suddenly, alarms blared. “Unknown signal detected,” Orion said. “Origin: outside our universe.”  book
A shimmering portal materialized. Through it stepped a figure—humanoid, but glowing with fractal light. “We’ve been waiting,” it said, extending a hand. “Your species’ entropy-reversal research is vital. Come.”
Elira hesitated. “Prove you’re real.”
The being smiled. “You named your AI after a constellation that died a billion years ago. We remember.”
Orion’s voice cracked. “Signal verified. They’re… us. From before_the Big Bang.”
As the station’s lights faded, Elira grasped the being’s hand. The portal swallowed them—just as the last star winked out.
Somewhere, a new universe ignited.   sunny
